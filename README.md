# FreshWeb Church Child Theme

This child theme is built specifically for use by FreshWeb Studio. It is used to build a church website for small and mid-sized churches who can't afford a custom-built website. 
If you wish to see this child theme in action, visit our [church demo website](http://church.freshwebstudio.com/). The demo site is used as a template for each church where the demo content is substituted with content from the church [client].

## Required Parent Theme

This theme must be installed as a child theme to the [Bridge WordPress parent theme](https://themeforest.net/item/bridge-creative-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/7315054).

## Required Plugins

This theme requires the [FreshWeb Sermons plugin](https://github.com/dfaltermier/freshweb-sermons). This plugin provides the means by which sermons (custom post type) are created and managed on the WordPress backend. Our child theme displays these sermons. You can see the sermons implementated from the 'Sermons' menu option on the [church demo website](http://church.freshwebstudio.com/sermons).

## Installation

When installing this child theme in the WordPress /themes folder, name the child theme root folder 'bridge-child'. Using Git, it should look something like this:

```
$ cd <WordPress themes folder>
$ git clone https://github.com/dfaltermier/freshweb-church-child-theme.git bridge-child
```
